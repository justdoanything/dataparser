We need to parse a type of data if we do a data migration or move the data from file to database sometimes.

This code makes it easy for us to convert the data.
  1. JSON format to Excel Format
  2. Excel format to Insert Query
  3. Interface data with JSON format to Excel format
  
You can copy the chart of excel and then copy to text file if you want to use excel data.
